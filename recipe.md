Directions

To make the dish, add onions and carrots to a large skillet and cook for five minutes. After adding your bell peppers and garlic, combine the cooked veggies with rice and toss well. Add frozen peas to the pan. Stir in the soy sauce and mix gently until everything is thoroughly combined and warmed through.

In just 25 minutes you'll have a dish that can compete with the fare at your favorite Chinese restaurant.
